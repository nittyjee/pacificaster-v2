    <p>
      We are a service from <a href = "https://pacificanetwork.org/">Pacifica Network</a>. The people who make these podcasts come from a variety of worlds: they are radio producers at community-based radio stations, Internet stations, and independent podcasters with grassroots vision. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Here, you will find a curated collection by podcasters who all share our mission of providing noncommercial podcasts for humanitarian democracy, with origins in grassroots community, progressive values, and sharing information and stories that further meaning and strengthen understanding. 
    </p>
    

    <h2>Why use this platform?</h2>

    <p>
      Whether you are a listener or producer, you will break through the noise of busy catch-all platforms and commercial productions and connect with the progressive mission based in local community that Pacifica has historically championed.
    </p>

    <h3>If you are a podcast listener:</h3>

    <p>
      Explore from our growing list of podcasts. Or, for a more local connection, start by exploring the podcasts offered from each local affiliate radio station. The list of participating stations is ever-growing - so check in occasionally!
    </p>

    <h3>If you are a podcast producer:</h3>

    <p>
      If you are at a Pacifica Network affiliated station, first inquire with your local station management to find out if they have a Pacificaster contributors’ account. If so, your local station managers can start the process of applying for your account.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are an independent producer, not at a Pacifica Network affiliate, you can apply to have your podcast hosted by Pacificaster or, if you have an existing podcast, to have it added to Pacificaster via your RSS feed.

    <p>
      Pacificaster.org is a service of <a href="https://pacificanetwork.org/">Pacifica</a>, the media group that pioneered community radio in the United States, representing and serving local community. The organization originated with the creation of KPFA in 1946 in Berkeley, California. Today, Pacifica owns five radio stations: WBAI in New York City, WPFW in Washington DC, KPFT in Houston Texas, KPFK in Los Angeles, and KPFA in the San Francisco Bay Area.

    <p>
      Historically, Pacifica has broken pivotal news stories and introduced issues and artists overlooked by mainstream media, playing a historic and unique role in American free and democratic media.
