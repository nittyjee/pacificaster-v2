      At the Pacifica Network, our goal is to further and sustain grassroots
      community around the world. We share content and build collaboration in
      audio production, journalism, technology, and support each other in
      community service.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over 250 community radio stations and production groups are active in the
      United States. Others are also located in Canada, Europe, and Africa. The
      network includes community radio stations, independent production groups,
      internet stations, low power stations, and college stations.

      Pacifica Network is managed by&nbsp;<a href="https://pacifica.org/"
        >Pacifica Foundation</a
      >. Pacificaâ€™s tradition of unhampered access to the airwaves has allowed
      our network to play a uniquely focal role in American media. We have
      broken pivotal news stories and brought issues and artists to the
      spotlight that may have been overlooked.

      Pacifica Foundation established the concept of community radio in the
      United States when it created KPFA in 1949 in Berkeley, California. Today,
      Pacifica owns WBAI in New York City, WPFW in Washington DC, KPFT in
      Houston Texas, KPFK in Los Angeles, and KPFA in the San Francisco Bay
      Area.
